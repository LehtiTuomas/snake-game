# snake-game
Online snake game done with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This was a very good learning project. I used CSS Flexbox to make the gameboard responsive and CSS Grid to make the 21*21 grid for the snake.
I tried to use as much ES6 as possible. For the animation, I used requestAnimationFrame to make it smooth and browser optimized.
